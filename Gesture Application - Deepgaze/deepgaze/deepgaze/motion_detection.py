    This class is the implementation of the article "An Improved
    Adaptive Background Mixture Model for Realtime Tracking with
    Shadow Detection" by  KaewTraKulPong and Bowden (2008).

    ABSTRACT: Real-time segmentation of moving regions in image
    sequences is a fundamental step in many vision systems
    including automated visual surveillance, human-machine
    interface, and very low-bandwidth telecommunications. A
    typical method is background subtraction. Many background
    models have been introduced to deal with different problems.
    One of the successful solutions to these problems is to use a
    multi-colour background model per pixel proposed by Grimson
    et al [1,2,3]. However, the method suffers from slow learning
    at the beginning, especially in busy environments. In addition,
    it can not distinguish between moving shadows and moving objects.
    This paper presents a method which improves this adaptive
    background mixture model. By reinvestigating the update equations,
    we utilise different equations at different phases. This allows
    our system learn faster and more accurately as well as adapt
    effectively to changing environments. A shadow detection scheme
    is also introduced in this paper. It is based on a computational
    colour space that makes use of our background model. A comparison
    has been made between the two algorithms. The results show the
    speed of learning and the accuracy of the model using our update
    algorithm over the Grimson et al tracker. When incorporate with
    the shadow detection, our method results in far better segmentation
    than that of Grimson et al.
